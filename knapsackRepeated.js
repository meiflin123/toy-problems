/*You are a renowned thief who has recently switched from stealing precious metals to stealing cakes because of the insane profit margins. You end up hitting the jackpot, breaking into the world's largest privately owned stock of cakesâ€”the vault of the Queen of England.

While Queen Elizabeth has a limited number of types of cake, she has an unlimited supply of each type.

Each type of cake has a weight and a value, stored in a tuple with two indices:

An integer representing the weight of the cake in kilograms
An integer representing the monetary value of the cake in British shillings
For example:

  # Weighs 7 kilograms and has a value of 160 shillings
(7, 160)

# Weighs 3 kilograms and has a value of 90 shillings
(3, 90)*/

function maxDuffelBagValue(cakeTypes, weightCapacity) {
  // Calculate the maximum value we can carry

  var table = {};

  for(var i = 0; i <= weightCapacity; i++) { 
    //store subsets
    table[i] = 0;
    
    for (var j = 0; j < cakeTypes.length; j++){
      var itemWeight = cakeTypes[j].weight;
      var itemValue = cakeTypes[j].value;
      
      if(itemWeight <= i){
        // if we take this item, V = v of this weight + v of rest weight(subset). Compare V with what's currently stored. 
        table[i] = Math.max(itemValue + table[i - itemWeight], table[i]) 
      } 
    }
  }
  
  return table[weightCapacity];
}
